I used Ai much less this week compared to some weeks in the past.
I did use it to help me cooking however, I had a chat about the engriedients I had and Claude created a great dinner recipe based off the ingredients in my house. 
The prompt was "What would you do with salmon a lemon a shallot spinach and Trader Joeâ€™s vacuole Pepe gnocchi"
It returned a very full proof recipe heres a small text snippet "With those ingredients, I'd make a delicious one-pan salmon and gnocchi dish! Here's what I'd do:
Pan-Seared Salmon with Lemon Spinach Gnocchi...

Start the gnocchi: Pan-fry the Trader Joe's gnocchi in a large skillet with some olive oil until golden and crispy on the outside. Remove and set aside. "

I also used it to help me add a 10k training plan into my workout routine. I gave it many small adjustments like cheange days based off fatuige, what I should do if i miss a day, and the best way i could train to reduce fatuige.

This week I only used AI for one thing. I am incredidbly bad at using the proper form of their or there.
I had a very long paper for another class that included many theirs and theres. I used Claude to help me with this.
i pasted my paper into claude and asked for it to point  out any of the times I used the improper form of there/their.
It returned 3 or 4 instances of where i used the wrong one, and explained why it was wrong. 
I then made all the edits to my paper and got a better insight on how to use the proper form of their/there

Journal 3------------------------------
This week I used AI to help plan my busy week. I first told Claude to listen to a bullet point list of all of the things I had to complete last week. I included times and dates that each task needed to be completed as well.
After that I asked Claude to create a daily schedule based around my class schedule that I pasted into the chat.
I noticed this is where the language started to struggle as I am assuming it is not that proficent at reading photos of things yet.
I noticed that Claude went over some of my classes and scheduled things during class. I used this schedule for the rest of the week after some tweaks though and it worked out great. 
I also once again used chatgpt for some grammar look overs and to review a paper I wrote. It worked great and as intended!
*edited while doing week 3 exercises
I did notice that I had to use google/ai for help with the week three exercises more then I would of liked. I think I struggled with these concepts in particular because we have past what I am doing in another coding class I am taking at this time.
It has been a considerable amount of time since I used these concepts in practice so using a AI aid helped me a good bit on problems I was very stuck on.

This week I used AI to assist me at work. I had to create a couple of Jira automation tasks and I use AI to help me with the Jira Query language syntax as well as guiding me through a lot of the things I need to complete. 
Jira can be very very tricky and it is definetley a topic that most models are trained well on whatsover. I do find that there are many many more mistakes then my usual AI endeavors when using it for JIRA help.
I was still abel to get tons of help and useful information from Claude to assist me however. 
I also used AI a bit to help my with my class exercises. I find having Claude help with the debugging allows me to see other viewpoints on how to complete tasks that can be very beneficial.
