I used Ai much less this week compared to some weeks in the past.
I did use it to help me cooking however, I had a chat about the engriedients I had and Claude created a great dinner recipe based off the ingredients in my house. 
The prompt was "What would you do with salmon a lemon a shallot spinach and Trader Joeâ€™s vacuole Pepe gnocchi"
It returned a very full proof recipe heres a small text snippet "With those ingredients, I'd make a delicious one-pan salmon and gnocchi dish! Here's what I'd do:
Pan-Seared Salmon with Lemon Spinach Gnocchi...

Start the gnocchi: Pan-fry the Trader Joe's gnocchi in a large skillet with some olive oil until golden and crispy on the outside. Remove and set aside. "

I also used it to help me add a 10k training plan into my workout routine. I gave it many small adjustments like cheange days based off fatuige, what I should do if i miss a day, and the best way i could train to reduce fatuige.
